# docker-compose-dsl

This is a very experimental approach to encode docker-compose file at a type level.

Design is heavily inspired by servant and *might* be overkill for given task but... :)

This library is incomplete and in heavy development. It has a LOT to improve hence suggestions/feedbacks/critiques are welcome!

# Documentaion (Pending)
